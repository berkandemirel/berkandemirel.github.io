## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="berkan.jpeg">

Hi! I am an R&D Engineer in the [Image Processing Group](http://havelsan.com.tr/ENG/Main/urun/1011/remote-sensing-and-image-processing) at [Havelsan Inc.](http://havelsan.com.tr/ENG/Main) I received my MSc degree from [Hacettepe University](http://hacettepe.edu.tr/english/), [Department of Computer Engineering](http://cs.hacettepe.edu.tr/) where I also received my undergraduate degree. During my graduate studies, I worked on attribute based representation and zero-shot learning problem, under the supervision of [Nazli Ikizler-Cinbis](http://web.cs.hacettepe.edu.tr/~nazli/) and [R. Gokberk Cinbis](http://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~gcinbis/).

## Research Interest

My primary research interest is machine learning and its applications in computer vision, natural language processing and remote sensing.

## News
* Dec. 2016 - I successfully defended my MSc thesis, under the supervision of Nazli Ikizler-Cinbis and R. Gokberk Cinbis. 
* May. 2016 - Our SIU 2016 paper received Alper Atalay Best Student Paper Award - Third Prize.
